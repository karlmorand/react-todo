# React-Todo

This is a simple todo-list I built while learning React. I plan to continue working on it (UI needs work, for ex.), but at the moment it allows a user to login, create todos, edit them, and complete them. 

**Tech used:**
- React
- ES6
- Babel & Webpack
- Firebase
- Google Auth
